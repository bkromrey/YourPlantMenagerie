# About
This is a simple database driven web app used to track the care and needs of your plants.

- [ ] TODO: add more to our README file describing the project


# Frontend
To launch the frontend, do the following.

```
cd webapp/frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --host
```

This is the dev version of the frontend. When we are ready to publish/upload this, we can use the publish option within Vite to do so. Need to do more research, as `npm run build` isn't working, perhaps due to the Routes.

# Backend
To launch the backend, do the following.
```
cd webapp/backend
npm install
npm start -- --host
```

# REMINDER

(TODO - delete this after cleaning up and citing all the starter code)

If you have adapted the CS340 starter app code this should be clearly stated in the readme (e.g. "All code is based on the CS 340 starter code, with the exception of...") and also in the source code to describe the extent to which any non-original sources were used (e.g. "this module adapted from the starter code"). 



# Citations 

A large majority of the code is based on the CS340 starter code which can be found at https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/react-starter-app\
Exceptions include some of the frontend framework which was generated directly from Vite (including App.jsx, components such as footer.jsx, navigation.jsx).
