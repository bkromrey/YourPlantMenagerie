# About
This is a simple database driven web app used to track the care and needs of your plants.

- [ ] TODO: add more to our README file describing the project


# Frontend
To launch the frontend, do the following.

```
cd webapp/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This is the dev version of the frontend. When we are ready to publish/upload this, we can use the publish option within Vite to do so. Need to do more research, as `npm run build` isn't working, perhaps due to the Routes.
